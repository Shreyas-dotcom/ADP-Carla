# ADP-Carla

ADP Carla is an Autonomous Devleopment Platoform for Autonomous Driving, on the Carla simulator. ADP Carla includes the most recent Python scripts and code that can run on the Carla Simulator.

### What is Carla? 

Carla is an open-source simulator for autonomuos driving researcj. Carla has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of an autonomous urban driving solution. Supporting a PythonAPI, and built on Unreal Engine 4, Carla empls high-end graphics to provide a suitable, and realistic representation of real world driving environments. Carla not only allows for the programming of vehicles, but also their onboard sensors, physics, and "NPC" or traffic that the vehicle may encouter. 


## ADP-CARLA Releases: 

In addition to offering all the individual Python Scripts, Shreyas Sharma's ADP-Carla repository also contains a very special, and unique release package. This packages all the different requirements that the Carla Simulator needs into 1 downlaodable ZIP file. After downloading and unzipping the file, a fully functional devleopment platform for Carla is ready to go, and can be used for development, simulation, and programming immediatley after instlattion, without the need of individually installing all the Python pependencies. 

Currently, the most recent release; V1.0, features the following: 
- Full Unreal Engine 4 
- Full Carla Environment with 6 Towns, and all vehciles
- Shreyas Sharma's Autonomous Parking Development
- Carnegie Mellon's AIO Drive Development + Sensors
- Examplar Scripts in Python
- All Python Dependancies



## Development

At the moment, ADP Carla is an ongonig project. I will continuously be updating the Python Scripts, and releases whenever a large change has been made. Please feel free to use any of the code, or environment I have devloped for your on research purposes - and be sure to push them onto the ADP Carla Repository!
